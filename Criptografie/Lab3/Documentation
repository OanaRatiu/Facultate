Systems of congruences

Firstly, we need to check if every n (x = y mod n1 ...) is prime with the others.
Then, if so, we need to compute the congruence of each equation.
Then, we just apply the formula:
	x = (a*N1*K1 + b*N2*K2 + c*N3*K3) % N;
	where 
		x = a mod n1;
		x = b mod n2;
		x = c mod n3;
