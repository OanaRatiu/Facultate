Affine Cypher

We need an order of letters(call it alphabet) and we shall compute its encryption, by this formula:
    - every letter has its index in the alphabet (i)
    - we have two values a and b
    - (a * i + b) % (length of alphabet)

Than, to compute the cyphertext (affine_word function) we need to look into the alphabet to find the
corresponding value in the encrypted alphabet, so we can return the letter.

The decryption goes like this, using the formula:
    - we need to find the numbers i and j for which (a * i) % (length of alphabet) = 1 
                                                and (b + j) % (length of alphabet) = 0
    - then, we compute the inverse of each letter :
         (((alphabet[letter] + j) % (length of alphabet) ) * i) % (length of alphabet)
